This project was the project to complete my studies at the Polytechnic University of San Juan. Therefore, it had to meet certain standards provided by the IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers). This project consists of creating an application for an urbanization in Puerto Rico, and facilitating the work of residents such as those of the administrative board. To meet this need, we decided to use the MERN Stack to be able to create this project and meet the customer's needs. Here are some of the tools and libraries we use:
- React
- Node Js
- MySQL
- Express
- Boostrap
- Axios  
*among others.*

My participation in this project was to be a Full Stack developer. Work on the frontend, backend and deploy the App to AWS (Amazon Web Service).
