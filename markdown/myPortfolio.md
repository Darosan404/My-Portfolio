This project consists of creating my first personal portfolio. For that I decided to use technology that was new to me. I also wanted to make a portfolio that was easy to modify and to which I could add features to improve the application in the future. For that I made a SPA (Single Page Application) and made a combination of tool and library that I am going to list below.
- Next Js
- React
- Chakra UI
- Markdown
- Vanilla JavaScript

It is a static application that you can easily update without compiling the application every time you update something. In the future I would like to add a nice backend so that I can modify the application from within the application and not have to go to the source code.
